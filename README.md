# UE_PaddlePong
An arcade classic, developed in Unreal Engine 5!

## Introduction
This the first game I'm creating for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/). It's a remake of the 1972 classic Arcade Game by Atari and functions purely as an exercise and as my first true step into game development.

## How To Play
The rectangular playing field is divided into two sides, each belonging to one player. Each player controls a paddle located at the far end of the respective side of the playing field. The paddles can be moved only on the vertical y-axis (up or down). 
A ball moves around on the field and the players must prevent it from hitting the wall on the far end of their side by deflecting it with their paddles. If the ball does end up hitting a wall, the other player scores a point and the ball is reset.
This goes on until one of the two sides reach 7 points first.
